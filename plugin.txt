methods plugins need:
- setup (for migration)
- list of handlers
- list of capabilities
- list of default roles (with capabilities) (will be inserted into db on site creation)

if a capability contains a '.' it will be excluded as a site-level capability
this means that all site-level capabilities can only use dashes e.g. administrate-roles
this encourages plugins to prefix object-level capabilities with the object name followed by a dot e.g. url.administrate
