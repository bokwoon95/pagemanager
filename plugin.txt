methods plugins need:
- setup (for migration)
- list of handlers
- list of capabilities
- list of default roles (with capabilities) (will be inserted into db on site creation)

if a capability contains a '.' it will be excluded as a site-level capability
this means that all site-level capabilities can only use dashes e.g. administrate-roles
this encourages plugins to prefix object-level capabilities with the object name followed by a dot e.g. url.administrate

plugin names are their repo URLs, and will be a separate column instead of being integrated with the role/tag/capability
it's unfortunate that this means that plugin tables will not be able to reference the pm_role/pm_tag table (because foreign keys cannot contain literal values) but it's a design tradeoff I'm making. I want the plugin name to be the repo URL, and everything follows.
